Shell script to enable/disable OverlayFS for Raspberry Pi OS

Inspired by (and with permission of) Mattias Wikstrom who posted the starting point at [Raspberry Pi Overlay Root Filesystem](https://yagrebu.net/unix/rpi-overlay.md) Mattias wishes to credit user ejolson for their help as well.

This is intended to duplicate the functionality found in `raspi-config` but scriptable and with some enhancements and to fully automate the process from the source instructions.
